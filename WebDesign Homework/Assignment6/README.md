# Assignment 6: Website Development - Cooking Website

## Chosen Website Idea

For this assignment, I have chosen to develop the **Cooking Website** idea that I started last week. This website will feature recipes, cooking tips, and food-related content. The tone will be fun and approachable, with vibrant images and easy-to-follow instructions to make cooking feel accessible for everyone.

## Reflection on Balance Concepts

This week, I applied the concept of balance by using simple CSS techniques like setting background colors and adjusting the width of elements. These small changes helped create a visually appealing layout that feels organized and well-spaced. 

I experimented with the float and margin properties to position images alongside text, and it helped me create a cleaner design. The layout evolved from a simple concept to something more structured with balance in mind.

### Challenges Encountered

One of the main challenges was balancing the content with the images. I had to adjust the widths and spacing to ensure the text wasn’t too cramped, and the images weren’t overwhelming. Using the float and margin properties made a huge difference, but it took some trial and error to get the positioning just right.
