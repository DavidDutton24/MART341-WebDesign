- **About Page**: Information about the creator or purpose of the website.
- **Contact Page**: A page where users can reach out.

## Pages:
- **Instructable**: This page will contain detailed steps, images, and possibly video for an easy-to-follow guide.
- **About**: The About page will explain the purpose of the site and the creatorâ€™s background.
- **Contact**: A contact form for users to submit inquiries or feedback.

## Tips for Building the Site:
