# Assignment 7: Cooking Website

## Project Overview
This week, I continued developing my cooking website. I added a second page that includes both a table to compare recipes and a form to collect feedback or suggestions from visitors. Simple CSS was used to enhance the design and maintain accessibility with alt text and titles for images.
## Reflection

1. **Most Proud Of:**  
   - The recipe comparison table turned out great! Adding images with descriptive alt text and titles really made the page visually engaging.
   - The form is simple but functional, and the mailto feature makes it easy for users to send suggestions.

2. **Challenges and Solutions:**  
   - Positioning the table and form together on one page was tricky. Adjusting the container width and spacing resolved the issue.
   - Ensuring images had appropriate alt text for accessibility required thoughtful descriptions.

3. **CSS Enhancements:**  
   - The background color and table styling added warmth and balance to the page.
   - Float and padding were used sparingly to align elements without cluttering the layout.
