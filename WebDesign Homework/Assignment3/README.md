# Assignment 3: GitHub Repository Setup & Markdown

In this assignment, I practiced setting up a folder structure in my GitHub repository and using Markdown to document the process. I followed the instructions to create a folder for **Assignment 3** inside the `WebDesignHomework` repository.

## Objectives:

- Create a folder named `Assignment3` in the `WebDesignHomework` repository
- Add a `README.md` file with various Markdown elements
- Experiment with Markdown language for documentation purposes

### What I Learned:

- **Markdown** syntax for headings, lists, links, and text formatting
- How to organize repositories on GitHub
- How to use different Markdown elements such as **bold**, *italic*, lists, and adding images

## Key Concepts:

- GitHub Repository Setup
- Markdown Syntax
- Folder Structure

### Issues Encountered:

- Initially, I had difficulty formatting the list items in Markdown, but after reviewing the Markdown Guide, I was able to fix it.

## Key Resources:

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)
- [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github)
