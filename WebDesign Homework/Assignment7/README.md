# Assignment 7: Website Development - Event Schedule

## Chosen Website Idea

For this assignment, I have chosen to develop an **Event Schedule** page for my cooking website. This page will feature a list of upcoming cooking events, such as cooking classes, food festivals, or live cooking demonstrations. The tone will remain fun and engaging, with easy navigation and visually appealing design elements.

## Reflection on Enhancements

This week, I’ve enhanced my website by adding a table to display event schedules and a form for users to submit inquiries. The table allows me to organize and showcase upcoming events clearly, while the form facilitates communication with the visitors.

I used simple CSS to improve the page’s appearance by adding background colors and adjusting image sizes. I also experimented with padding to improve spacing and layout.

### Challenges Encountered

The most challenging part of this week’s assignment was styling the form and table to be visually appealing. Ensuring the form fields were aligned correctly and the table rows were evenly spaced required a lot of trial and error. I overcame this by using inline CSS for fine-tuned control over spacing and positioning.
