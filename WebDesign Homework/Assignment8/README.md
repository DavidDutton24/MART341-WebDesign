# Assignment 8: Website Development - Music Playlist

## Techniques Used in This Assignment

### Div
- **Usage**: I used `<div>` elements to group different sections of my webpage, like the audio playlist, video showcase, and text descriptions. This helped with organization and allowed me to apply styles (e.g., padding and background colors) consistently across sections.

### Span
- **Usage**: I applied the `<span>` element to style specific parts of the text within the playlist section. For example, I used `<span>` to apply a different color to song titles and artists’ names. This ensured the page had a clean, organized appearance while providing emphasis on key content.

### Audio
- **Usage**: I embedded an audio player to allow users to listen to a selection of music tracks. This enhances the user experience by giving them access to the audio content directly on the site.

### Video
- **Usage**: I embedded a video showcasing an artist’s performance. This helped to complement the audio playlist with visual content and added an engaging element for the visitors.

### Iframe
- **Usage**: I used an `<iframe>` to embed a YouTube video of a live concert. This lets users watch videos without leaving the page and makes the website more interactive.

### Class
- **Usage**: I applied the `.song` class to style individual song elements and the `.video` class to format the video section. These classes helped organize the layout and maintain consistency in design across different parts of the page.

### Escape Character
- **Usage**: I used the escape character `&amp;` to properly display an ampersand (&) in the artist’s name without breaking the HTML code.

## Reflection on Website Design

For this assignment, I created a **Music Playlist** page that includes audio, video, and visually appealing sections. I’ve used `<div>` to organize content and `<span>` for fine-tuned text styling. The audio element is the central feature, allowing users to listen to music directly on the page. I also integrated video content to complement the audio playlist and engage users. The iframe was a nice touch for embedding live performances from YouTube, enhancing the interactive feel of the site.
