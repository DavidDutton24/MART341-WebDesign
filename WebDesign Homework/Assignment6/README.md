# Assignment 5: GitHub Setup and Website Ideas

In this assignment, I set up my GitHub repository and began brainstorming website ideas for future projects. I also completed a markdown exercise in which I filled in blanks about the tools and services we use in web development.

## Fill in the Blanks

Visual Studio Code (or Atom) is the tool we use to **create** and edit our code files and directories.

README.md is a markdown file that uses markdown language to describe the **contents** of a repository.

HTML files are used to create webpages for the web, with the main homepage file always named **index**.html.

GitHub Desktop helps us organize files on our computers and **push** them to GitHub.com.

GitHub.com is used to **host** our project files.

GitHub Pages **hosts** our websites, and in order to view a specific page, we need to include the entire file path to the URL, including all subdirectories.

Canvas is our virtual **classroom** where we can access the weekly content, discussions, assignments, and quizzes.

The external course website functions as our **textbook**.

## My Website Ideas

In this assignment, I brainstormed three website ideas:

1. **Personal Blog**: An informal blog to share personal stories.
2. **Cooking Website**: A website for sharing recipes, cooking tips, and food-related content. The tone will be welcoming and fun, with vibrant images of dishes and detailed instructions.
3. **Portfolio Website**: A professional website to showcase my projects and skills.

You can see more details and the images Iâ€™ve chosen in my `index.html` file.
