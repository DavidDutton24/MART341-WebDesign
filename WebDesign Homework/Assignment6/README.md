# Assignment 6: Cooking Website

## Idea Explanation
I've chosen to develop the cooking website idea because cooking is a passion of mine, and I want to share recipes and cooking tips with others. The site will have a modern and playful tone, making it approachable for beginners and fun for experienced cooks.

## Reflection
- Adjusting the background color and widths helped create a balanced and visually appealing layout.
- Initially, I had more crowded content, but tweaking widths and margins improved the readability.
- Experimenting with float and margin for the image was interesting, though it took a few tries to get the positioning right.
- Challenges: Ensuring balance with CSS, especially when mixing floats and widths. I overcame this by testing different values and referencing examples.
