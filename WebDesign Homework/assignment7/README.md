# Assignment 7: Cooking Website

## Project Overview
This week, I continued developing my cooking website. I added a second page that includes both a table to compare recipes and a form to collect feedback or suggestions from visitors. Simple CSS was used to enhance the design and maintain accessibility with alt text and titles for images.
