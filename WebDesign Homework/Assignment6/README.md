# Assignment 6: Cooking Website

## Idea Explanation
I've chosen to develop the cooking website idea because cooking is a passion of mine, and I want to share recipes and cooking tips with others. The site will have a modern and playful tone, making it approachable for beginners and fun for experienced cooks.

## Reflection
- Adjusting the background color and widths helped create a balanced and visually appealing layout.
- Initially, I had more crowded content, but tweaking widths and margins improved the readability.
- Experimenting with float and margin for the image was interesting, though it took a few tries to get the positioning right.
- Challenges: Ensuring balance with CSS, especially when mixing floats and widths. I overcame this by testing different values and referencing examples.

1. **Balance Adjustments:**
   - Setting the background color to a light grey (#f9f9f9) improved readability.
   - Using widths for the container ensured the content stayed centered and balanced.
   - Margins around the image added whitespace, improving layout flow.

2. **Initial vs. Final Design:**
   - The original idea was simple but lacked structure. Adding headings, quotes, and semantic elements made it more engaging.
   - Adjustments to the imageâ€™s float and size helped balance the text and visuals.

3. **Challenges:**
   - It took a few tries to get the image positioned correctly with the float and margin properties.
   - Experimenting with the width of the container helped me avoid overcrowded content.
