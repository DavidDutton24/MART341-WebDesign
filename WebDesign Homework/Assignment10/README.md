# Assignment 10: External CSS with Various Design Techniques

## Page:
This week, I am working on the **faq.html** page.

## Required Techniques:
1. **External CSS Style Sheet**: All styles are defined in a separate `style.css` file, linked to the HTML document.
2. **Class Selector**: I used a class selector to style sections of the FAQ page with common properties.
3. **ID Selector**: I used an ID selector to style the main container of the FAQ page uniquely.

## Additional Techniques:
1. **Different Background Colors**: I experimented with multiple background colors for different sections to create a distinct look for each part of the page.
2. **Different Font Colors**: I used different font colors for headings and body text to enhance readability and create visual interest.
3. **Text Alignment**: Text alignment was adjusted for titles and sections for better structure and presentation.
4. **Borders**: Borders were applied to sections for a clear separation of content, giving the page a more organized look.
5. **Opacity**: I applied opacity to images to create a subtle background effect without overwhelming the content.
6. **Positioning**: I used positioning to place the FAQ section properly and make sure content is aligned correctly.

## Summary of Techniques:
I applied these techniques to improve the visual appeal and readability of my FAQ page. The external CSS file helped keep styles organized, and using selectors for specific sections allowed for cleaner and more manageable code.
