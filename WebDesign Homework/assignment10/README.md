# Assignment 10: Web Design with External CSS

## Pages Worked On:
- **index.html**: The main landing page for the site.

## Required Techniques:
1. **External CSS Style Sheet**
   - Created `style/style.css` and linked it to the HTML file to centralize styling.
   
2. **Class Selector**
   - Used `.highlight` to style emphasized sections.

3. **ID Selector**
   - Used `#header-title` to uniquely style the header title.

## Additional Techniques:
1. **Different Background Colors**
   - Applied distinct background colors to the header and footer to create visual separation.

2. **Different Font Colors**
   - Styled text with contrasting colors to improve readability.

3. **Text Alignment**
   - Used `text-align: center` to align the content in the header and footer.

4. **Borders**
   - Added borders to images to frame them neatly.
   
5. **Opacity**
   - Applied slight opacity to hover effects on buttons to enhance interactivity.

## Why These Techniques Were Used:
- External CSS simplifies maintenance by centralizing all styles.
- Class and ID selectors allowed for targeted styling, making the design more flexible.
- Additional techniques enhanced the visual appeal and usability of the site.
